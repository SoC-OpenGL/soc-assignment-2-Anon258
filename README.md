# Assignment-2-Modelling Viewing Pipeline and Phong Shading
Since the problems are built upon each other, I have done all the required parts in a single program.
The shading mode can be changed by b/B (initially in Blinn Phong Shading)
The light caster can be changed by n/N (initally point light, then directional then spotlight)
Camera view is tracked by cursor, translation by WASDZX (front, left, back, right, down, up) and zoom in/out is done by p/o keys (dont have mouse to try out scroll callback)
The yellow text is the FPS and the red text below is the vertex count
